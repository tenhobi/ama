Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever.

I am currently a 20-years-old highschool student, web developer (well, mostly front-end), developer at [Nottelo](http://nottelo.com), proud member of [Nouvelle Communauté](http://nuvel.eu) and big lover ❤ of **Angular 2** and **Sass**!

I'm [@tenhobi](https://twitter.com/tenhobi) on Twitter.
